		<h1>Condition</h1>
		
		<p>A condition (short for condition variable) is a synchronization device that allows threads to suspend execution and relinquish the processor until some predicate on shared data is satisfied.</p>
		<p>The basic operations on conditions are:
			<ul>
				<li>signal the condition when the predicate becomes true,</li>
				<li>wait for the condition, suspending the calling thread's execution until another thread signals the condition.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>A condition variable must always be associated with a mutex to avoid the race condition where a thread prepares to wait on a condition variable and another thread signals the condition just before the first thread actually wait son it.</p>
		<p>Cloning is disabled for the condition class.</p>
		
		<article id="dtor">
			<h2>~condition ()</h2>
			<p>Destroys this condition, freeing all resources it might hold. No thread must be waiting on this condition on entrance.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="exception.html#permission">permission</a> is thrown if there are waiting threads for this condition.</li>
			</ul>
		</article>
		
		<article id="ctor">
			<h2>condition (<a href="mutex.html">mutex&</a> guard)</h2>
			<p>Constructs a new condition.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="exception.html#resource">resource</a> is thrown if there are not enough system resources to create a new condition.</li>
			</ul>
		</article>
		
		<article id="signal">
			<h2>void signal | notify ()</h2>
			<p>Restarts one of the threads that are waiting on this condition. If no thred is waiting on the condition then nothing happens. If several threads are waiting on the condition then exactly one is restarted, but is is not specified which.</p>
			<p>Best practice is to lock the associated <a href="mutex.html">mutex</a> before signaling the condition, however this is not enforced. This guarantees that the condition cannot be signaled (and thus ignored) between the time a thread locks the associated <a href="mutex.hml">mutex</a> and the time another thread waits on the condition.</p>
		</article>
		
		<article id="broadcast">
			<h2>void broadcast ()</h2>
			<p>Restarts all threads that are waiting on this condition. If no thread is waiting on the condition then nothing happens.</p>
		</article>
		
		<article id="wait">
			<h2>void wait ()</h2>
			<p>Atomically unlocks the associated <a href="mutex.html">mutex</a> and waits for this condition to be signaled. The calling thread's execution is suspended and doesn't consume any CPU time until the condition is signaled. The associated <a href="mutex.html">mutex</a> must be locked on entrance to this function.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="exception.html#permission">permission</a> is thrown if the associated <a href="mutex.html">mutex</a> was not locked by the calling thread.</li>
				<li><a href="exception.html#thrcancel">thrcancel</a> is thrown if the calling thread was canceled.</li>
			</ul>
		</article>

		<article id="waitduration">
			<h2>void wait (const <a href="duration.html">duration&</a> span)</h2>
			<p>This function behaves the same as wait(), but the wait is restricted to a given time span. If the condition was not signaled within the given time frame then the associated mutex is re-acquired and a <a href="exception.html#timeout">timeout</a> exception is thrown.</p>
			</p>The given time span specifies a relative time and can only be strictly positive. If the <a href="duration.html">duration</a> is negative or zero then the function immediately throws the <a href="exception#timeout">timeout</a> exception.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="exception.html#permission">permission</a> is thrown if the associated <a href="mutex.html">mutex</a> was not locked by the calling thread.</li>
				<li><a href="exception.html#timeout">timeout</a> is thrown if the wait timed out.
				<li><a href="exception.html#thrcancel">thrcancel</a> is thrown if calling thread was canceled.</li>
			</ul>

		<h1>Synopsis</h1>
		<p>#include &lt;lisle/condition.h&gt;</p>
		<h2>class condition</h2>
		<ul class="public">
			<li><a href="#dtor">~condition ()</a></li>
			<li><a href="#ctor">condition (mutex&)</a></li>
			<li><a href="#signal">void signal | notify ()</a></li>
			<li><a href="#broadcast">void broadcast ()</a></li>
			<li><a href="#wait">void wait ()</a></li>
			<li><a href="#waitduration">void wait (const duration&)</a></li>
		</ul>
		<p>cloning is disabled</p>

		<h1>Cancellation</h1>
		<p>Both wait functions are cancellation points. If a thread is cancelled while suspended in one of these functions then the thread immediately resumes execution and throws the Lisle internal cancel exception. Thus the complete call stack is unwound and all object destructors executed.</p>
		
		<h1>Async-Signal Safety</h1>
		<p>The condition functions are not async-signal safe, and should not be called from a signal handler. In particular, calling either signal() or broadcast() from a signal handler may deadlock the calling thread.</p>
